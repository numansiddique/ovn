      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

.. TODO(stephenfin): Flesh this out with information from the general
   installation guide, among others.

The vsperf project aims to develop a vSwitch test framework that can be used to
validate the suitability of different vSwitch implementations in a telco
