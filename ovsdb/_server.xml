  <p>
    Every <code>ovsdb-server</code> (version 2.9 or later) always hosts an
    instance of this schema, which holds information on the status and
    configuration of the server itself.  This database is read-only.  This
    manpage describes the schema for this database.
  </p>

  <table name="Database" title="Databases.">
    <p>
      This table describes the databases hosted by the database server, with
      one row per database.  As its database configuration and status changes,
      the server automatically and immediately updates the table to match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clients can use the <code>_uuid</code> column in this table as a
      generation number.  The server generates a fresh <code>_uuid</code> every
      time it adds a database, so that removing and then re-adding a database
      to the server causes its row <code>_uuid</code> to change.
    </p>

    <column name="name">
      The database's name, as specified in its schema.
    </column>

    <column name="schema">
      The database schema, as a JSON string.
